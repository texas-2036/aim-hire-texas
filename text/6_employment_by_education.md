To prepare workers for in-demand jobs that pay a living wage, we need to strengthen Texas' education pipeline. The charts below provide a current snapshot of employment and earnings outcomes by educational attainment in this WDA.

The top row shows data on college graduates of Texas institutions from the Census Bureau's Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (PSEO) dataset. It includes information on employment and earnings outcomes from graduates of 75% of Texas' colleges and universities. More info [here](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/pseo_experimental.html).  

The bottom raw shows data on earnings and employment on residents over 25 by their level of educational attainment. The data comes from the American Community Survey, 2015-2019.
