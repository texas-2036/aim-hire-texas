The table below lists all jobs and shows their scores in terms of quality, demand, and total share of the local job market.

Green shading indicates the occupation in above average in an area, while red shading indicates below average. You can sort the table based on quality or demand, or search for an occupation. By default, the table is sorted by a composite score of quality and demand.
