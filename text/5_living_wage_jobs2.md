Living wage jobs are also concentrated in particular industries. The next chart shows the number and share of jobs in each major industry that are currently paying a living wage in this WDA.

Wage breakdowns by industry were calculated based on data on median wages in 2018 by industry, occupation and WDA, which were downloaded from https://texaslmi.com/. Wage band breakdowns (High, Medium-High, Medium-Low, and Low) were calculated using a similar methodology to the ALICE Project (see above). Living wage jobs are those in the High and Medium-High categories. The breakpoint between high and medium-high wage jobs was $20,000 above the ALICE threshold, and the breakpoint between medium-low and low wage jobs was $20,000 below the ALICE threshold. These breakpoints were adapted from a separate analysis by the Boston Consulting Group for Aim Hire Texas (for more info on that analysis see: https://www.aimhiretexas.org/research_and_findings).
