Although Texas has achieved impressive economic growth, **too many Texans are not earning a living wage**, which could limit continued growth. The first goal of the Aim Hire Texas Initiative is to build stronger households by increasing the number of Texas households earning a living wage.

There are a number of ways to define a living wage. The ALICE Project is an initiative focused on workers and households who are **A**sset **L**imited, **I**ncome **C**onstrained, and **E**mployed - households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level, but less than the basic cost of living for the county (the ALICE Threshold). For more information see [here](https://www.unitedforalice.org/county-profiles/texas).

The chart below shows recent trends (2010-2018) in the share of households in this WDA that earn above and below the ALICE Threshold based on their incomes and number of family members. The second chart compares different family types based on the share living above and below the ALICE living wage threshold.
