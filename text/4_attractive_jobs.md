The **Quality Index** measures two dimensions of an occupation's quality: its local median wage and its upward mobility (defined as its prospects of leading to a higher-wage job than other occupations at a comparative wage level within five years). The **Demand Index** is an overall measure of demand for a given occupation in the local labor market, based on its historical and projected contribution to local job growth.

The upper half of the chart shows high-quality occupations, while the right half shows high-demand occupations. Consequently, the upper right quadrant includes the most promising occupations according to both quality and demand for jobs.
