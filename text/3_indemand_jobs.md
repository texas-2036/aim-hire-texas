Which jobs will be most and least in-demand in 2028? The charts below show the jobs projected to be most in-demand in 2028 for the selected WDA and Texas as a whole. Use the selector to view least in-demand and highest growth jobs. As in the Living Wage Jobs section above, these are based on 2028 projections from the [Texas Workforce Commission](https://texaslmi.com/LMIbyCategory/Projections). Importantly, those projections do not take into account changes in demand for jobs due to automation. For information about how automation may impact future demand for certain types of jobs, read more [here](https://www.faethm.ai/blog/blogs/new-technologies-create-new-opportunities). Better data, including longer-term projections that account for the effects of automation, can help state and regional leaders, policymakers, and advocates more effectively address the future needs of the workforce.
