Which jobs will be most and least in-demand in 2036? The charts below show the jobs projected to be most in-demand in 2036 for the selected WDA and Texas as a whole. Use the selector to view least in-demand and highest growth jobs. As in the Living Wage Jobs section above, these are based on 2018-2028 projections from the [Texas Workforce Commission](https://texaslmi.com/LMIbyCategory/Projections). Texas 2036 then extrapolated to 2036 using an annualized growth rate from the 2018-2028 projections and applied it to future years by workforce board area and occupation. If these projections do not align with what you envision for the future of our state and each region, consider what community leaders, advocates, and policymakers should do to make sure our workforce meets its future needs. Furthermore, what needs to happen so that Texans are equipped with the skills and education required for future jobs?

Importantly, those projections do not take into account changes in demand for jobs due to automation. For more information about how automation may impact future demand for certain types of jobs, read more [here](https://www.faethm.ai/blog/blogs/new-technologies-create-new-opportunities).
