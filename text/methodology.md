## Data Sources
**Living wage households and characteristics** are based on analysis of American Community Survey data by the ALICE Project (https://www.unitedforalice.org/texas). This metric uses a standardized set of measurements to quantify the cost of a basic household budget in each county in each state, and to show how many households are struggling to afford it. More information on their methodology can be found here: https://www.unitedforalice.org/methodology.

Projections of the **size and characteristics of the future workforce** come from the Texas Demographic Center’s Population Projections, 2010-2050 (https://demographics.texas.gov/data/tpepp/projections/). 

**In-demand jobs in 2028** are based on 2018-2028 projections by the Texas Workforce Commission, which were downloaded from https://texaslmi.com/.

Data on **living wage jobs** were calculated based on data from multiple sources. First, data on median wages in 2018 by occupation and WDA were downloaded from https://texaslmi.com/. We then categorized jobs as paying a living wage based on whether the median wage was above or below the ALICE Project’s cost-of-living-adjusted threshold for a two adult, two child household (for a full county breakdown see https://www.unitedforalice.org/household-budgets/texas). WDA thresholds were calculated by taking the population-weighted average across counties in each WDA.

Wage breakdowns by industry were calculated based on data on median wages in 2018 by industry, occupation and WDA, which were downloaded from https://texaslmi.com/. Wage band breakdowns (High, Medium-High, Medium-Low, and Low) were calculated using a similar methodology using the ALICE Project’s cost-of-living-adjusted threshold for a two adult, two child household (see above). Living wage jobs are those in the High and Medium-High categories. The breakpoint between high and medium-high wage jobs was $20,000 above the ALICE threshold, and the breakpoint between medium-low and low wage jobs was $20,000 below the ALICE threshold. These breakpoints were adapted from a separate analysis by the Boston Consulting Group for Aim Hire Texas (for more info on that analysis see: https://www.aimhiretexas.org/research_and_findings). 

Data on **attractive jobs** come from the Brookings Institution’s Texas Workforce Development Toolkit. More info on their methodology can be found here: https://brookingswof.shinyapps.io/TX_workforce_dev_app/.

Data on the **earning and employment of post-secondary graduates at Texas institutions** comes from the Census Bureau's Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (PSEO) dataset. It represents data on graduates 10 years after graduation and comes from 75% of Texas’ colleges and universities. WDA-level estimates reflect only colleges and universities that are within the geographic boundaries of the WDA.

Data on **earnings and employment of Texas residents by educational attainment** comes from the American Community Survey, 2015-2019.

## Workforce Development Areas

The Workforce Development Areas (WDAs) used in this analysis are largely based on the regional boundaries defined by the Texas Workforce Commission. WDAs are clusters of Texas counties grouped by shared economic and labor market ties. The traditional TWC-defined WDAs include 28 regions. This analysis consolidated these regions into 24 by combining Capital Area & Rural Capital WDAs into “Greater Austin”, Greater Dallas, Tarrant County, and North Central WDAs into “DFW,” and Lower Rio Grande Valley and Cameron WDAs into “RGV.”
